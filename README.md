Hi!  This repository is for homework assignment 12, Web Scraping and Document Databases, for Georgia Tech Data Science & Analytics Boot Camp.

My web application was created by using Python and HTML languantes, Web Scraping and Splintering, and Flask rendering.

Below is picture of the final product, where scrapes multiple Mars related websites, store the data (latest news, feature image, table of facts, and hemispher images) in a Mongo DB, and displays it on an HTML page.

Thanks for stopping by!
